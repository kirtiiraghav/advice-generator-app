# Advice Generator App

This is a solution to the [Advice Generator App Challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/advice-generator-app-QdUG-13db). This project demonstrates the use of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to fetch and display random advice from an API, with local storage to persist data across page reloads.

## Overview

### The Challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Generate a new piece of advice by clicking the dice icon
- See the last generated piece of advice even after refreshing the page, thanks to local storage

## What I Learned

Working on this project helped me solidify my understanding of:

- Using local storage to persist data across page reloads.
- Manipulating the DOM based on API responses and user interactions.
